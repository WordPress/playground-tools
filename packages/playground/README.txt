= Short description =

Enables running a sandbox of your site using WordPress Playground (https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground)

== Description ==

With this plugin, you can:

* Create a copy of your site in a private WordPress Playground instance.
* Test plugins from the WordPress plugin directory without actually installing them on your site.

Your site is cloned in Playground by copying all the files and a database into WordPress Playground. It may sound scary, but your data stays safely with you and is **not** uploaded to any cloud service. Instead, your site's data is shipped directly to your web browser where it stays only as long as you keep your browser tab open. Thatâ€™s right! WordPress Playground runs a copy of your site directly on your device.

== Usage ==

= Starting a sandbox =

- Open `/wp-admin/` on your site
- Click on _Sandbox Site_ in the _Tools_ menu to load WordPress Playground with a copy of your site content

= Testing a plugin =

- Open `/wp-admin/` on your site
- Click on _Add Plugins_ in the _Plugins_ menu
- Find a plugin you want to test
- Click the _Preview Now_ button
- The plugin will be installed and activated in WordPress Playground with a copy of your site content

== All features ==

- Start a sandbox of your site
- Preview a plugin installation from the WordPress.org repository
- Export Playground snapshots using Tools > Export
